# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage serves as my first project as I begin my journey as a web developer. It allowed me to learn, implement, and practice some of the basic skills that I hope to build on as the bootcamp progresses. It will also serve as a reference, as it contains helpful pieces of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that I'll be using in the future.

## Usage

This study guide contains sections on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, and it implements each langauge functionally. Opening the code for the page will also exhibit some of the basic elements of each language. Opening DevTools will demonstrate JavaScript running, and will offer a randomized suggestion of which section to study first.
